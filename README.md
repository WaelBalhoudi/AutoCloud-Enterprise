# 📖 Project Overview

AutoCloud Enterprise is a **production-inspired Linux infrastructure project** designed to demonstrate real-world **Linux System Administration**, **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**, **DevOps automation**, **private cloud deployment**, **identity management**, **enterprise storage**, **monitoring**, and **security hardening**.

The entire infrastructure is automatically deployed using **Vagrant** and **Ansible**, while modern applications are delivered through **Docker Compose**.

This project simulates the IT infrastructure of a medium-sized enterprise and follows industry best practices for automation, documentation, security, and maintainability.

# 🚀 Deployment Workflow

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<username>/AutoCloud-Enterprise.git
```

Enter the project directory:

```bash
cd AutoCloud-Enterprise
```

Provision the infrastructure:

```bash
vagrant up
```

Deploy and configure the environment:
